	<h2>No process left behind.</h2>
	<p>
	  Imagine an environment in the world of comuting where resources are shared, not hoarded. Instead of your world starting at boot with a king of all odds forming a strict rule of everything you can and can not do, you are instead presented with an assortment of opportunities to claim anything and everything. Government of the people still exists, but the power goes to the people.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Enter the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exokernel"><span style='color: #f8512f;'>exokernels</span></a>, where direct access to resources such as memory and hardware IO (if seperable) is allowable given good cause. Exokernels provide a world where abstraction is a choice, not a necessity. This approach can provide a number of benefits if carefully implemented such as increased performance and stability.
	</p>

	<h2>A focused concept</h2>
	<p>Xlii (Pronounced System 42) needs only a few components to form a working system: A boot stub, a memory manager, a stream manager and a process manager. Xlii is unique in the fact that there is no process scheduler. Instead, processes that require a main loop form a linked list, while others (called services) just hang out somewhere in coordinated memory. All of these processes are coordinated but not driven by the process manager.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There is no concept of prioritized scheduling in Xlii's design, however the Xlii project values a simple mechanism we call "Data movement before data processing". This simply means that the movement of data between processes and hardware or other processes  is valued higher than the distribution of cputime to each process running on the system. Before any process continues execution all data is moved to their destinations via the stream manager.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Streams are an important component of the Xlii operating system. The stream manager coordinates the streams, and the streams coordinate the data for all Inter-Process Communication (IPC). Processes are also capable of representing themselves as streams with a main loop for purposes such as networking where the other end of the stream may be thousands of miles accross the planet. It is also important to note that system calls are non traditional, and are performed over streams.
